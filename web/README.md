# The editor

The Angular application. Everything it compiles, assembles and plays lives in `../packages`; what is
here is the UI, the four state services, and the adapters that join CodeMirror and Web Audio to
framework-free code.

Run everything from the repository root, not from here. `npm start`, `npm run build` and
`npm run watch` each have a pre-hook that bundles the worklet, mirrors the SPC package's assets into
`public/`, and writes the commit SHA — none of the three is checked in, and `ng serve` skips all of
them.

## Layout

| Path              | What it is                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/app/state/`  | Four `@Service()` singletons, in dependency order             |
| `src/app/editor/` | The source pane: CodeMirror, transport, mixer, sample browser |
| `src/app/output/` | Diagnostics, stats, the ARAM bar, the command inspector       |
| `src/app/shared/` | Form controls, panels, icons, chart helpers                   |
| `src/app/util/`   | Formatting, IndexedDB, `clamp`                                |

State flows one way: `DriverStore` → `SampleStore` → `EditorStore` → `Playback`.

`DriverStore` loads `packages/spc/assets/driver/`. The song's ARAM load address is the slot the
driver's own song pointer table reserves, stated in the bundle's `manifest.json` and checked against
the image by `spctest`. **There is no fallback address** — until the driver loads, compilation is
blocked rather than run against a guess.

`EditorStore` debounces typing (150 ms) into a `committed` signal that a `computed` compiles.
Diagnostics, stats, the ARAM budget and the hex dump are all `computed` off that one result.
`buildSpc` is a method rather than a `computed` because it copies 64 KiB of ARAM plus every sample —
wasted work on each keystroke.

## Preview and commit

Everything that edits MML writes back through `EditorStore.replace`, which recompiles. So a control
that committed on every `input` event would push a recompile through the typing debounce once per
frame of a drag, and the commit's own recompile would feed a new value back down and yank the thumb
out from under the pointer.

`amk-slider` is where that contract lives:

- `preview` fires continuously, for anything cheap and local — a graph redrawing, a readout counting.
- `commit` fires once, when the gesture ends.
- `pending` holds the dragged value in front of the bound one until it does.

`value` is an `input`, not a `model`: a commit is a gesture, not a change, and a two-way binding
cannot express "the source of truth updates when I let go". Readouts are computed from the
_previewed_ value — a label derived from the document would sit there describing the number you are
dragging away from.

## Reaching into the editor

The editor owns the CodeMirror view, so nothing else may touch it. Two signals on `EditorStore` are
how a sibling panel asks:

- `reveal` — select and scroll to a span, set when a diagnostic is clicked.
- `replace` — apply a splice, set when a panel edits a command in place.

`replace` carries `expect`, the text the splice believes occupies the span. Panels read the
_undebounced_ scan, so their spans agree with the document — but only up to the microtask that
carries the edit across, and a control that fires on `pointerup` is one gesture away from a document
that has moved. The editor compares before it dispatches, which turns that whole class of race from
silent corruption into an edit that simply does not take.

`EditorStore.apply` ignores the `null` the splice builders return when nothing would change. A
slider fires per frame of a drag, and "that is the text already there" is what keeps a drag from
pushing dozens of identical recompiles through the debounce.

## The CodeMirror adapter

`editor/codemirror/` is the only place that knows CodeMirror exists. `mml-language.ts` is 44 lines:
`@amk/tokens` exposes `step` / `startState` / `copyState` in exactly the shape `StreamLanguage`
wants, and `TOKEN_TAGS` holds `@lezer/highlight` tag _names_ as strings so the package itself stays
CodeMirror-free. This is the one place those names resolve to `Tag` values, and `tokentest` asserts
every one of them is real, so the cast is a checked one.

## Accessibility

**This app ships no ARIA attributes and no `role` or `tabindex`.** That is a deferral, not an
oversight — see the note in the root `CLAUDE.md`. The global `:focus-visible` outline in
`styles.css` is a different concern and must not be removed by components.

## Two AudioContexts

`SpcPlayer` owns one for song playback. `Playback` owns a second for one-shot sample audition. They
are separate on purpose: auditioning a sample must not interrupt or be interrupted by the song.

## Persistence is optional

The MML draft goes to `localStorage`; the sample library to IndexedDB via `util/idb.ts`, which
resolves rather than rejects on every path. Storage is genuinely optional — private browsing, an
exhausted quota — and must never stop someone compiling a song.

## Charts

Only `aram-bar` draws with d3, and it is the only component that needs `shared/chart/stack.ts` and
`element-size.ts`. The four inspector graphs are Angular-templated SVG over a fixed viewBox from
`shared/chart/plot.ts`, stretched to their container, so stroke widths and offsets are in viewBox
units rather than pixels.

`fir-graph`'s frequency axis is **linear**, DC to Nyquist, which is not what an audio plot usually
does. Eight taps at 32 kHz have no authority below a couple of kHz, so a log axis would spend most
of its width on the part of the spectrum the filter cannot address, and push the nulls and ripple
that actually distinguish one filter from another into a corner. The cost is that hearing is
logarithmic and this is not.

## Panels build view models, not methods

A `computed` of rows with everything resolved, rather than a method called per row in the template —
see `sample-browser.ts`, `aram-budget.ts` and `stats-grid.ts`. `@angular-eslint`'s
`template/no-call-expression` is the rule that would enforce this, and it cannot be used in a signals
codebase where every read is a call; the structure is what keeps the bug out instead.
