# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) working in this repository.

## What this is

Solar Soundtrack — a browser-based AddmusicK 1.0.11 MML editor. It compiles MML to N-SPC song data,
assembles a playable `.spc`, and plays it through an emulated SPC700, entirely client-side. No ROM,
no AddmusicK install, no server.

## Layout

An npm workspace. **Every command runs from the repository root.**

```
packages/core/          @amk/core      types, AddmusicK's tables, hex
packages/mml-compiler/  @amk/compiler  preprocess -> parser -> link
packages/mml-tokens/    @amk/tokens    scanner, splices, command model
packages/spc/           @amk/spc       BRR, echo FIR, ARAM, emulator, worklet
web/                    the Angular editor
scripts/                thirteen byte-level harnesses
```

```
@amk/core      → nothing
@amk/compiler  → core
@amk/spc       → core
@amk/tokens    → core, and @amk/spc/{adsr,fir}
web            → all four
```

Each package has a `README.md` and that is where the long explanations live — the port's citation
convention, why the driver is observed rather than predicted, what the scanner can and cannot mirror
from the parser, what the harnesses actually prove. Read the one for the package you are changing.

`AddmusicKsrc/` and `AddmusicKreadme/` hold a local copy of AddmusicK 1.0.11's C++ sources and its
readme. They are **gitignored and not part of the repository**, but they are the reference
implementation this project is a port of and the code cites them constantly — take them from an
AddmusicK release if they are missing.

## Commands

Node 24 is what CI uses. CI runs `npm run lint` then `npm run check`.

| Command             | What it does                                                          |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm start`         | Dev server on `http://localhost:4200/`.                               |
| `npm run build`     | Production build into `web/dist/`.                                    |
| `npm run watch`     | Dev-configuration build with `--watch`, no server.                    |
| `npm run lint`      | ESLint over every workspace.                                          |
| `npm run format`    | Prettier over the workspace.                                          |
| `npm run typecheck` | The app. `:packages` and `:scripts` cover the rest.                   |
| `npm run check`     | The merge gate: formatting, three typechecks, all thirteen harnesses. |

`npm run check` does **not** compile Angular templates, and neither does `npm run typecheck` — `tsc`
does not run the template compiler, so a bad binding (`viewBox=` instead of `[attr.viewBox]=`)
passes `check` and fails only at `npm run build` / `npm start`. Run one of those before believing a
UI change.

### Automatic pre-hooks

Never invoke these by hand. `prestart` / `prebuild` / `prewatch` in `web/package.json` run the first
two and the third; `pretypecheck` there and `prelint` at the root run `generate-git-info` alone,
which is all either needs:

- **`build:worklet`** — `@amk/spc`'s own build; esbuild bundles `worklet.ts` into
  `assets/player/spc-worklet.js` (generated, gitignored). An AudioWorklet is loaded by URL from the
  audio thread, so the Angular builder cannot produce it as part of the app bundle.
- **`sync-spc-assets`** — mirrors `packages/spc/assets/` into `web/public/`. The Angular builder
  refuses an asset path outside its own workspace root; the copies are gitignored and
  `packages/spc/assets/` is the only source of truth.
- **`generate-git-info`** — writes `web/src/app/git-info.generated.ts` for the toolbar's commit link
  (generated, gitignored). Captured once at startup, so it goes stale if you commit while
  `npm start` is running; restart to refresh.

### Tests

There are no `.spec.ts` files — `npm run test` is Angular scaffolding and runs nothing. The real
suite is the thirteen harnesses under `scripts/`; **`scripts/README.md` says what each one proves**,
and several of those assertions are load-bearing in ways that are not obvious from the name.

`scripts/Compare-Spc.ps1` and `scripts/Compare-SongBin.ps1` diff output against a real AddmusicK
build. Those are what establish fidelity; the harnesses only catch gross breakage.

## Rules

**The port cites its source.** Around 350 comments reference `Music.cpp:3209`, `AddmusicK.cpp:1138`,
`globals.cpp:735`, `main.asm` and so on, against AddmusicK 1.0.11 in `AddmusicKsrc/`. Read the cited
lines before changing compiler behaviour, and cite the lines you port. Behaviour that looks strange
is almost always strange in the original too — reproduce it and say so in a comment.

**The compiler is not permissive.** A song written here is going into AddmusicK, so a divergence in
either direction is a bug: accepting what AddmusicK rejects means it compiles, plays, and then the
real tool refuses it; rejecting what AddmusicK accepts means a working song is turned away. Where
AddmusicK is case-sensitive, so is this — `#Title`, `"kick.BRR"` and `#DEFINE` are all errors, and
`#SAMPLES` is not, because `strnicmp` is what the reference uses there. Convenience is never a
reason to widen what is accepted, and neither is helpfulness a reason to narrow it: an unknown
`#directive` is read as music and `*` with no previous loop emits a call to nowhere, because that is
what the reference does. `packages/mml-compiler/AUDIT.md` is the record of the last line-by-line
comparison; there are no deliberate divergences left in the compiled output.

**`packages/mml-compiler` is not linted, and its comments are not thinned.** It is a port, and style
rules would make it harder to diff against the C++ that is the only check on its faithfulness. It
gets one ESLint rule, an import boundary. Prettier still runs.

**Package boundaries are a lint rule.** npm links every workspace into `node_modules/@amk`, so
TypeScript resolves a sibling package however the tsconfigs are written; `no-restricted-imports` in
`eslint.config.js` is what actually holds the graph. Adding an edge means changing that rule
deliberately.

**Ticks, not seconds.** Anything that follows the music uses driver ticks. The driver's main loop
processes at most one tick per iteration, so a busy song drops ticks (~0.8% on eight channels) and no
formula over tempo can be exact; a playhead built on one drifts further every pass round the loop.
`stats.tagSeconds` / `introSeconds` / `mainSeconds` are AddmusicK's own arithmetic, kept for the
ID666 header and for labels, and are a few percent out by design.

This is a rule about **denomination, not just about arithmetic**. Nothing that follows the music
stores or accepts seconds: the seek bar's `max` and `value` are ticks, `Playback` holds one playhead
in ticks, and `player.seek` and the worklet take the tick itself — the worklet stops on its own tick
count rather than on a sample count, so a seek lands where it was asked to. Seconds appear at exactly
two edges: as the m:ss **label** `web/src/app/state/song-clock.ts` derives from a tick, and for the
fade past the end of the song, where the driver has stopped reading music data and there are no ticks
left to count. The conversion has no inverse on purpose — seconds are produced and never consumed, so
no position round-trips through a clock. Adding a `tickAtSeconds` back means a seconds-denominated
control got in, and that is the thing to fix instead.

The compiler's own seconds — `stats.tagSeconds` / `introSeconds` / `mainSeconds`, the ID666 header
and the "Length" tile — are outside this: they are AddmusicK's arithmetic, reported as it reports it.

**And the tick rate itself is measured, not assumed.** The driver runs at most one tick per pass of
its main loop, so a song asking for more than it can manage gets fewer — 46% of the requested rate on
a real eight-channel `t254` song, where the ~0.8% above is an ordinary-tempo figure. No formula
predicts it, because it depends on the work each tick costs. `web/src/app/state/measure-clock.ts`
plays the song on a worker and records when each tick really arrived; `AMK0503` reports it. Anything
that turns ticks into seconds must go through `EditorStore.clock`, which serves the measurement where
there is one and the prediction where there is not.

**`sampleList: null` is not `[]`.** `null` means the compiler had no opinion and the driver's default
set stands; `[]` means the song genuinely asks for no samples. The list's _order is the SRCN
assignment_, so building an SPC against a different set produces a valid-looking file that plays the
wrong sounds. It is a correctness-critical output, not a statistic.

**Diagnostics carry source spans and stable `AMK####` codes**, and are carried on failure paths too,
so partial UI stays populated. Spans are mapped back to the source the author wrote — `spanAt` is
the single choke point, and anything that bypasses it will be wrong. Constructs this compiler does
not implement are reported as errors, never silently mis-compiled.

**This project ships no ARIA attributes and no `role` or `tabindex`.** Accessibility is deferred,
not attempted-and-abandoned, so half of it is worse than none: the tab strip used to point
`aria-controls` at ids that no longer existed. `angular.configs.templateAccessibility` is therefore
absent from the template lint block, and the "Accessibility Requirements" section of
`web/.claude/CLAUDE.md` does not apply here — that file is generated by the Angular CLI and is kept
byte-identical to what the CLI emits, so the override is stated here instead. The global
`:focus-visible` outline is a different concern and must not be removed by components.

**The changelog is part of the feature.** `web/src/app/changelog/changelog-data.ts` backs the top
bar's changelog popup. A commit that adds or materially changes a user-facing feature adds its entry
**in the same commit** — a new block at the top of `CHANGELOG` if the date is new, otherwise one more
string in the existing block for that date.

Write for **music porters, not developers**, and keep it to a short phrase naming the feature:
"Sample browser & importer", not a sentence about how it works. How something is implemented never
belongs here, however interesting. Refactors, internal work and small fixes get no entry at all. It
is hand-written and must never be generated from commit subjects, which are not written for users.

## Angular specifics

Angular 22, zoneless (scaffolded `--zoneless`, so zone.js is not a dependency and there is nothing
to opt into), no router, no NgModules. Signals throughout: `signal`/`computed` for state, `effect`
reserved for mirroring into imperative sinks (localStorage, the player, the DSP). State lives in
four `@Service()` singletons in `web/src/app/state/`, in dependency order `DriverStore` →
`SampleStore` → `EditorStore` → `Playback`. `web/README.md` has the rest.

Selector prefix is `amk` — `amk-root`, `amk-editor-pane` for components, camelCase `amk*` for
directives. ESLint enforces both.

Styling is Tailwind v4, with the entire theme as CSS variables in `web/src/styles.css` (v4 has no
`tailwind.config.js`). Dark-only on purpose. Two **validated categorical sets** live there —
`--color-seg-*` for the ARAM bar and `--color-ch-*` for the eight music channels — and neither may be
reordered or re-hued without re-validating, since adjacent-pair CVD separation and contrast against
`--color-surface` are the properties being preserved. The order is the mechanism, not decoration: it
is what the adjacent-pair check runs against. `--color-ch-*` does not clear the all-pairs gate and no
set of eight can, so nothing may leave channel identity to colour alone; `styles.css` says what
carries it instead.

Framework-generic Angular 22 conventions (signal APIs, `@Service()`, host bindings, control flow)
live in `web/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, which the Angular CLI generated via `--ai-config=claude` and can
regenerate. Keep project-specific guidance here instead, so that file stays safe to overwrite.

## Formatting

Prettier owns the whole workspace, in two profiles split by layer — `web/src/app/` at 2 spaces,
single quotes, width 100; `packages/` and `scripts/` at tabs, double quotes, width 120, carried over
from the pre-Angular prototype so the port can still be diffed against AddmusicK's C++. Both are in
`.prettierrc`, with matching `.editorconfig` sections so editors agree; **change both or neither**.
Never hand-format — run `npm run format`, and `npm run check` fails on anything Prettier would
rewrite.

`endOfLine` is `"auto"` because the working tree is CRLF. Prettier's `"lf"` default makes every file
fail `--check` for reasons that have nothing to do with formatting.

Two regions carry `// prettier-ignore`, both because reflow destroys information rather than because
someone preferred the old layout: the MML command dispatch in `parser.ts`, which is a lookup table
one line per case, and the one hand-annotated byte table in `selftest.ts`, where each line is a
little-endian word with its own comment. Add a marker only for that kind of reason, and say what it
is.

Reformats are listed in `.git-blame-ignore-revs`. Enable it with
`git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs` so `git blame` on the ported compiler keeps
pointing at the port.

## Linting

`eslint.config.js` at the root is where the conventions above stop being prose. One config for every
workspace, run as plain `eslint` — `ng lint` is only a wrapper, and flat config does not walk up
from `web/`, so a second config there would drift.

Rules that exist to hold a property the codebase already has (`prefer-signals`,
`prefer-service-decorator`, `inject-at-top`, `consistent-type-imports`, and the template rules) are
set to `error` rather than `warn` — though `--max-warnings 0` means a warning would fail the run
just the same, so the level says which of the two a rule is rather than whether it bites.

Several rules are deliberately **off**, each with its reasoning inline in the config. Read that
before switching one on: `no-unnecessary-condition`, `template/no-duplicate-attributes` and
`template/button-has-type` report only false positives here, and `template/no-call-expression`
cannot tell a signal read from a method call, so it flags 405 correct lines. The bug that last rule
would catch is kept out structurally instead.

One block sits **after `eslintConfigPrettier`**, and has to: it holds `curly` and
`padding-line-between-statements`. Neither is something Prettier can do — it never adds braces and
never inserts blank lines, only collapses them — so this is the one place where layout is a lint
rule. `eslint-config-prettier` switches `curly` off, so setting it in any earlier block would be
silently undone. `npm run lint:fix` fixes both; run `npm run format` after it.

To prove the scoping is what you think it is, diff `npx eslint --print-config` over
`packages/mml-compiler/src/parser.ts`, `packages/spc/src/fir.ts` and `web/src/app/app.ts`. Those
resolve 1, 121 and 146 rules respectively.

## Deployment

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` lints and checks every push and PR; pushes to `main` additionally build
with `--base-href=/<repo-name>/` and deploy `web/dist/solar-soundtrack/browser` to GitHub Pages. The
build must go through `npm run build` rather than `ng build` so the prebuild hooks still run. The app
is a PWA (`web/ngsw-config.json`); the service worker is enabled in production builds only.
